providers and resolvers in hybris:

when to use providers and resolvers:
both are more or less same

solr is used for searching

providers in hybris:
implements fieldValueProvider or FieldNameProvider
overrides getFieldValue or getFieldName methods
returns the value of the field we want to index

the value resolvers are a more eficient replacement for the current value providers

groups index properties using same value provider

extends AbstractValueResolver

overrides addFieldValues method

both are used to send data to solr

provider - when we need to send some data to solr after manipulating it instead of directly sending the value from DB

resolver - when we need to change the local context then use resolver
