synchronization:
replicating or cloning the catalog of data from version A to version B

types of catalogs:
catalog,
content catalog,
classification catalog - classification features
there is no such thing as product catalog it is just a naming convention

two types of synchronization:
single threaded(not recommended in project)
multi threaded(lot of data so best option)

using catalog version diff we can understand what all things are still not in sync

multi threaded means more than one thread to have faster sync

in the edit configuration of the synchronization cron job u can select the things that you want to sync and deselect the others

scope of a job restriction is only within that particular job

smartedit:
not a new feature,liveEdit adddon(in the older versions)

newer version of an existing feature

one common userid is shared or separate userId's but not admin and nimda

if u don't see the basestore in smartedit then in the content catalog u have to assign yourself to the permissions section in content catalog 

navigation management is where all the navigation that u create reside
